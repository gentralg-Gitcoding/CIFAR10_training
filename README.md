This repository demonstrates deep learning techniques for image classification using the CIFAR-10 benchmark dataset. Through a series of progressively more sophisticated models, it shows how different neural network architectures and training techniques improve classification performance.

**Package**: The tools developed for this project are available as [`image-classification-tools`](https://pypi.org/project/image-classification-tools) on PyPI for use in your own projects.

**Documentation**: [https://gperdrizet.github.io/CIFAR10/](https://gperdrizet.github.io/CIFAR10)

## About the dataset

CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32×32 color images across 10 classes:
- **Training set**: 50,000 images (40,000 for training, 10,000 for validation)
- **Test set**: 10,000 images
- **Classes**: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

## The models

1. [`01-DNN.ipynb`](notebooks/01-DNN.ipynb) - Baseline fully-connected deep neural network on grayscale images
2. [`02-CNN.ipynb`](notebooks/02-CNN.ipynb) - Convolutional neural network to exploit spatial relationships
3. [`03-RGB-CNN.ipynb`](notebooks/03-RGB-CNN.ipynb) - CNN modified to process full RGB color information
4. [`04-optimized-CNN.ipynb`](notebooks/04-optimized-CNN.ipynb) - Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with Optuna
5. [`05-augmented-CNN.ipynb`](notebooks/05-augmented-CNN.ipynb) - Data augmentation for improved generalization

## Visualizations

Each experiment includes:

- **Learning curves**: Track training and validation loss/accuracy over time
- **Confusion matrices**: See which classes the model confuses
- **Class probability distributions**: Understand model confidence
- **ROC curves**: Measure classification performance across all classes
- **Precision-recall curves**: Examine trade-offs for each class
- **Optimization landscapes**: Visualize hyperparameter sensitivity (Experiment 4)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gperdrizet/CIFAR10.git
cd CIFAR10
```

2. Open in VS Code:
```bash
code .
```

3. When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** or use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P) and select **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**

4. Wait for the container to build and initialize (first time only). The devcontainer will:
   - Set up the Python environment
   - Install all dependencies
   - Download the CIFAR-10 dataset

### Running the notebooks

Once the container is ready, open and run notebooks in sequence:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01-DNN.ipynb
```

### Pre-trained models

Models from each experiment are saved in `models/pytorch/`:
- `dnn.pth` - Baseline DNN
- `cnn.pth` - Basic CNN
- `rgb_cnn.pth` - RGB CNN
- `optimized_cnn.pth` - Hyperparameter-optimized CNN
- `augmented_cnn.pth` - Final model with augmentation

## Environment

All experiments use:
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (when available)

## Dependencies

Core requirements:
- `python` ≥3.10, <3.13
- `torch` ≥2.0
